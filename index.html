            Hello, my name is Ahleem Akinwande. I was born and raised in Philadelphia, where I also currently reside. I attended college at The Pennsylvania State University, where I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Criminology in 2016. After graduating, I worked as a Bartender, Patient Advocate for worker's compensation claims, and currently a Parole Officer. During the Covid-19 lockdown, I spent my newly found freetime re-evaluting my values and what I am passionate about. It was at that time that I stumbled across FreeCodeCamp and decided to start self-learning. I spent time learning a bit of HTML, CSS, and Javascript; I then came across LaunchCode in early 2022, where I was able to further my education with Javascript and introduce myself to Java as well. I am currently a part of their cohort and set to complete the course in October of 2022.
